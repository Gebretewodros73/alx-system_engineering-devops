#Bash Script Examples
This repository contains Bash scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts, including generating RSA keys and using for, while, and until loops.

##Generating RSA Keys
The generate_rsa_key.sh script generates an RSA key pair using the ssh-keygen command. It prompts the user for a file name to save the keys to and an optional passphrase to protect the private key. The script then saves the keys to the specified file and outputs the public key to the console.

##For Loops
The for_loop.sh script demonstrates a simple for loop that iterates over a range of numbers and prints each one to the console.

##While Loops
The while_loop.sh script demonstrates a simple while loop that reads input from the user and stops when a certain condition is met.

##Until Loops
The until_loop.sh script demonstrates a simple until loop that iterates until a certain condition is met.
