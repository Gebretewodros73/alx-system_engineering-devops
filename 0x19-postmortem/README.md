# Web Stack Debugging and Incident Management

## Introduction

In the world of software engineering and web development, challenges are inevitable. Systems might fail due to various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, and more. The ability to handle failures effectively, learn from them, and prevent their recurrence is crucial for any software engineer. This project focuses on the practice of identifying and resolving web stack issues and conducting postmortems to understand the root causes of incidents.

## Task 0: My First Postmortem

### Scenario

Imagine a situation where a web application experienced an outage, resulting in downtime and user dissatisfaction. As responsible engineers, we need to conduct a postmortem to understand the incident's impact, root cause, timeline, actions taken, and corrective measures.

### Requirements

- Issue Summary: A concise description of the outage, including its duration, impact on users, and root cause.
- Timeline: Detailed account of when the issue was detected, how it was identified, actions taken, and any misleading paths.
- Root Cause and Resolution: Thorough explanation of the underlying cause and how it was resolved.
- Corrective and Preventative Measures: Recommendations for improvements and specific tasks to address the issue.

## Issue Summary
- Duration: 2 hours, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC)
- Impact: The web server experienced a complete outage, causing all services hosted on it to become unavailable. Users reported a 503 Service Unavailable error.
- Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer's routing settings led to incorrect distribution of incoming traffic, overwhelming the web server and causing it to crash.

## Timeline
- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring tools reported a sudden drop in the response time of the web server.
- 10:15 AM: The engineering team was alerted to the problem and began investigating.
- 10:30 AM: Initial investigation indicated that the server's CPU usage was abnormally high.
- 10:45 AM: The team incorrectly assumed the problem was related to a recent software update and started investigating that direction.
- 11:00 AM: After trying multiple software rollback attempts without success, the team escalated the incident to the infrastructure team.
- 11:15 AM: The infrastructure team noticed a misconfiguration in the load balancer's routing settings and realized that all incoming requests were being sent to a single server instance.
- 11:30 AM: The load balancer's configuration was corrected, and traffic was evenly distributed among server instances.
- 12:00 PM: The web server was back online, and all services were restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause: The load balancer was misconfigured, sending all incoming traffic to a single server instance. This resulted in an overload of requests, causing the server to become unresponsive and crash.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration in the load balancer's routing settings was corrected. Additional monitoring was implemented to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Corrective Measures:
  - Implemented immediate load balancer configuration fix to distribute traffic evenly.
  - Conducted a thorough review of server logs to identify potential data loss or corruption.
- Preventative Measures:
  - Implemented automated tests for load balancer configurations before deploying changes.
  - Set up proactive monitoring to detect and alert on load balancer misconfigurations.
  - Scheduled regular load testing to identify potential scaling issues and bottlenecks.
  - Improved incident escalation process to involve infrastructure teams sooner.
