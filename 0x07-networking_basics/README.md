# Networking Basics

This repository contains a series of exercises and tasks to help you learn the basics of networking. The goal is to gain a fundamental understanding of networking concepts, protocols, and tools that are commonly used in IT and computer science.

## Topics Covered

The exercises and tasks in this repository cover the following topics:

- IP addressing and subnetting
- Routing and switching
- DNS and DHCP
- Network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, etc.)
- Network tools and utilities (ping, traceroute, netstat, etc.)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each topic covered. Each directory contains exercises and tasks with detailed instructions and examples.

Here is an overview of the repository structure:

- `0-OSI_model`: The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology. It is organized from the lowest to the highest level, with each layer responsible for a specific set of functions that build upon each other to facilitate communication between devices. Despite being a conceptual model, the OSI model provides a standardized framework for network design and enables different hardware and software systems to communicate with each other. By defining clear boundaries and functions for each layer, the OSI model allows for greater interoperability and simplifies the process of troubleshooting and debugging network issues.
- `1-types_of_network` :  A computer in a local network is typically connected to a LAN (Local Area Network). A network that connects an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away is typically connected through a WAN (Wide Area Network). Browsing www.google.com from a smartphone not connected to the Wifi uses the Internet, which is a global network of networks.
- `2-MAC_and_IP_address` : A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface. An IP address is a number used to identify devices on a network, similar to how a postal address identifies a house.
- `3-UDP_and_TCP` :  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures all the data is delivered error-free in the correct order, although this can result in slower transmission speeds. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is an unreliable, connectionless protocol that prioritizes speed over reliability, which can result in lost or out-of-order packets. TCP worker asks for acknowledgement of data reception and confirmation of successful delivery before sending more data.
