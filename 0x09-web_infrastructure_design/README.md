## Project Sections

### 0-simple_web_stack

The "0-simple_web_stack" project focuses on setting up a basic web stack. It covers fundamental components such as a web server, TCP/IP, codebase, and web server configuration. It explains concepts like Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), codebase, web server, and HTTP/HTTPS.

### 1-distributed_web_infrastructure

The "1-distributed_web_infrastructure" project expands on the previous section and introduces distributed architecture. It explores the challenges and considerations when designing a web infrastructure that can handle increased traffic and distribute the workload across multiple servers. It covers load balancing, server clusters, and DNS.

### 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure

In the "2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure" project, the focus is on security and monitoring aspects of a web infrastructure. It discusses HTTPS, web server security, encryption, and monitoring tools. It highlights the importance of securing the traffic between the browser and the website and explains the role of HTTPS in achieving this.

### 3-scale_up

The "3-scale_up" project delves into scaling up the web infrastructure to handle larger workloads and accommodate more users. It covers techniques such as database optimization, caching, horizontal scaling, and vertical scaling. It explains the concept of databases and their role in storing, accessing, and managing large amounts of data efficiently.
